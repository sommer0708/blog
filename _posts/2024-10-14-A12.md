## The Night *Before Sunrise*

We sat upon the sofa, dusk grew night,

No whisky there, no cola by our side.

Then quick as thought, you killed the evening light,

And air grew thick with words we meant to hide.



No glances met, no daring move was made,

Still we could see their love's spread in between.

Their bodies close, yet worlds apart they stayed,

Maybe a reflection of us on screen.



Two sparks of stardust settled on our skin,

They lingered there, unsure if they should fuse.

Was it just sex or something lost within?

A hunger one could taste, yet still refuse.



We drifted near, then let the moment die -

Is this the romance worth one more try?
